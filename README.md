# 2D Platformer Game

This is my first game created with the Godot game engine.

This project is based off the tutorial: [Start Your Game Creation Journey Today! (Godot beginner tutorial)](https://youtu.be/5V9f3MT86M8?si=6LpY27OlJcok2WKW)

Export presets have been created for both Windows Desktop and macOS. Or you can download exported versions from the following google drive folder: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xeMbygSrbQmpB6rhVaMtrttvQVYXsDwK?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xeMbygSrbQmpB6rhVaMtrttvQVYXsDwK?usp=sharing)
